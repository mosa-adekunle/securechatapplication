Instructions: - - Each group (three students) should register on the following link by week 3 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe72Z3RKo_4qzHNj_GRNyjMY8HgtBsG0 boU6ZDmbZWN0sg-qw/viewform 
Top (3) projects will receive honor certificates        
Description: This project enables users to securely chat and exchange text. The sender and receiver should share the secret key in symmetric cryptographic techniques. The sender uses the preshared key and select one of the cryptographic techniques to encrypt the plaintext. The receiver uses the same preshared key and the same technique to decrypt the ciphertext. In the asymmetric techniques, the sender uses his/her private key for encryption and the receiver uses the sender’s public key for decryption. Sender Plaintext:  Key: Technique: Ciphertext: Encrypt Send Receiver Ciphertext:  Key: Technique: Plaintext: Decrypt Figure 1: A simple example of the secure chat application Techniques:   1- Caesar cipher 2- Monoalphabetic 3- Polyalphabetic 4- Hill cipher 5- Playfair 6- OTP 7- Rail fence 8- Columnar  9- DES 10- AES 11- RC4 12- RSA 13- ECC 14- DH for key exchange 15- Hashing (SHA) for integrity checking 16- DSA for signature - -
